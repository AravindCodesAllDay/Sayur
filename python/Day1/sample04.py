# problem #4
# write a program to find if two strings are same.
# two string are considered same if both strings have same letters in same order, but from different starting point
# eg abcd is same as bcda (a is moved to the right)
# abcd is same as cdab 
# abcd is  not same as cdba

# 123456 = 456123
# 123456 not = 412356
# hint - 
# there are many simple answers. you can try with slice function
